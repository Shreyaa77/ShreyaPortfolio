            The beautiful moon in the night sky inspired me to capture it. 
            This empty street at night gives a feeling of longing for some reason. The
            street-lights along with the moon and the car headlights gives a
            perfect aesthetic shot. </p>
            <p className="story2 text-center">
            To capture the moon I turned down the light in my camera settings completely. This made the
            moonlight, the streetlight and the car headlights pop out. 
            Giving us this beautiful aesthetic shot.

            In this photo I wanted to show my love for reading. I love reading
            books so I thought what better way to convey that than this picture.
