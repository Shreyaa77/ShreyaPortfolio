          I’m Shreya, an international student at the University of Limerick.
          </p>
          <p className="me">
            For over four years, I’ve worked in various areas of Information
          Technology, focusing on managing, maintaining, and troubleshooting
          computer systems. 
          </p>
          <p className="me">
          Currently, as I pursue my Master’s, I spend my time
          researching, designing, prototyping, and coding. 
          </p>
          <p className="me"> When I'm not studying, I enjoy curling up with a good book or sketching and
          dreaming about traveling the world.
